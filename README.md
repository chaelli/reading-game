# Reading Game

This is a simple reading game for children. The game displays a random word and three images. The child needs to read the word and select the correct image. If the correct image is chosen, a nice animation is shown, and the child can move to the next word. If the wrong image is chosen, the child can either try again or move to the next word.

## How to Run the Game Locally

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/githubnext/workspace-blank.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd workspace-blank
   ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## How to Deploy the Game as a Website Using GitHub Pages

1. Push the code to a GitHub repository.
2. Go to the repository settings.
3. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.
4. Select the `main` branch as the source.
5. Click "Save".

Your game will be available at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`.
